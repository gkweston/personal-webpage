    <h2>
			Where are you from?
		</h2>
    <p>
			I come from a military family, and as a result I&apos;ve split my life between Washington and Texas (among 
			other places). This has given me the amazing opportunity of experiencing different cultures and perspectives 
			from across the country!
		</p>
		<h2>
			What do you do?
		</h2>
    <p>
			I am a fulltime student studying Computer Science at Texas A&M University, which is a longtime passion of mine. 
			This probably began with programming videogames on my TI-84 calculator in High School along with designing simple 
			circuits to modify guitar effects pedals and amplifiers. I also work as a Peer Teacher in the Department of 
			Computer Science, which allows me to take what I&apos;ve learned and share it with other students in a more 
			informal setting than the traditional classroom.
		</p>
    <h2>
			What are you interested in?
		</h2>
    <p>
			I&apos;m interested in seeking a career in software development which places a heavy focus on intelligent systems 
			design and integration. I am currently seeking intern and co-op positions which may enrich these skills across 
			various industries.
		</p>
    <h2>
			Why intelligent systems?
		</h2>
		<p>
			It&apos;s a dream of mine to see how artificial intelligence could change the way we do tasks such as memory 
			management on a fundamental level. From quicker, more efficient operating systems, to distributed networks that 
			require less maintenance and resources.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How has service impacted your life?
		</h2>
		<p>
			I believe that the core tradition of service at Texas A&M has molded every student in a diverse way. However, 
			for me it has been helping other students where they struggle in academics. But most importantly, learning and 
			remembering to have fun in the process!
		</p>
		<h2>
			Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Working as a senior developer at a major firm designing and integrating technology in new and impactful ways. 
			All while making people&apos;s lives a little easier and a lot more fun.
