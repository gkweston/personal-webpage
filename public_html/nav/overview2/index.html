<section class='intro-questions'>
	<h2>Where are you from?</h2>
	<p>I come from a military family, and as a result I&apos;ve split my life between Washington and Texas (among 
		other places). This has given me the amazing opportunity of experiencing different cultures and perspectives 
		from across the country!</p>
	<h2>What do you do?</h2>
	<p>I am a fulltime student studying Computer Science at Texas A&M University, which is a longtime passion of mine. 
		This probably began with programming videogames on my TI-84 calculator in High School along with designing simple 
		circuits to modify guitar effects pedals and amplifiers. I also work as a Peer Teacher in the Department of 
		Computer Science, which allows me to take what I&apos;ve learned and share it with other students in a more 
		informal setting than the traditional classroom.</p>
	<h2>What are you interested in?</h2>
	<p>I&apos;m interested in seeking a career in software development which places a heavy focus on intelligent systems 
		design and integration. I am currently seeking intern and co-op positions which may enrich these skills across 
		various industries.</p>
	<h2>Why intelligent systems?</h2>
	<p>It&apos;s a dream of mine to see how artificial intelligence could change the way we do tasks such as memory 
		management on a fundamental level. From quicker, more efficient operating systems, to distributed networks that 
		require less maintenance and resources.</p>
	<h2>How has service impacted your life?</h2>
	<p>I believe that the core tradition of service at Texas A&M has molded every student in a diverse way. However, 
		for me it has been helping other students where they struggle in academics. But most importantly, learning and 
		remembering to have fun in the process!</p>
	<h2>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2>
	<p>Working as a senior developer at a major firm designing and integrating technology in new and impactful ways. 
		All while making people&apos;s lives a little easier and a lot more fun.</p>
