		Texas A&M University has a long-standing tradition of selfless service, honor and sacrifice for the community. I am proud

		Honors student I get the opportunity to graduate with distintion while giving back to my community. Below is a linke where you 
		can learn more, along with brief descriptions of some of the activities I have been able to take part in.
